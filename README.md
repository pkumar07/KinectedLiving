# KINECTed-LIVING

KINECTed LIVING is a gesture and speech-controlled system wherein a user can control the lights and fans in a living space.
The speech command is responsible for changing the state of the device whereas the gesture aids in identification of the device.
Additionally, the users have the choice of performing the same commands with either gesture or speech solely. 
The devices are controlled centrally via an Arduino Uno board.
